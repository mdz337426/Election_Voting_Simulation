## Election Voting Simulation
This program simulates an election process where multiple polling booths are used, and voters cast their votes for one of several candidates. The simulation is implemented using child processes in C++, where each polling booth is handled by a separate process. The program records votes for each polling booth in individual files and logs them in a global log file. After all booths complete their voting, the program tallies the votes and announces the winner.
